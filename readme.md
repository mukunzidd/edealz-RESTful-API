# eDealz API

*edealz-RESTful-API* repo hosts, the source code for an ExpresJS API that I'm building for a Mini-Capstone project that I am building in the MEAN stack. This is where all the hustle reside.


## Run this api on your local machine

- Make sure that you have Node.JS installed
- Make sure you have npm installed
- Make sure that you have MOngoDB installed
- Create a database called edealzapi with _mongo_, _show sbs_, _use edealzapi_.
- Then change the working directory whre you want to clone this api
- Then run npm install to install all the node modules
- Use a browser extension to make HTTP request. u may want to try Postman or RESTeasy for chrome.
